Description:

**Linear_regression_mv**:
In this notebook I present a work on multivariable linear regression using Boston house-price dataset, first selecting the two variables with the most correlation with the desired target variable for prediction, then training a multivariable regression model, and finally plotting the hypersurface generated by the predictions of the model and comparing it with the actual data.

**Logistic_regression_mv**:
In this notebook I present a work on multivariable logistic regression using Iris dataset, there are three possible categories for classification.

**Linear discriminant analysis**:
\begin{itemize}
	\item LDA seeks to reduce dimensionality while preserving 	as much of the class discriminatory information as 	possible
	\item Assume we have a set of ??-dimensional samples 	${x_{1},...,x_{n}}, N_{1}$ of which belong to class 	$w_{1}$, and $N_{2}$ to class $w_{2}$
	\item We seek to obtain a scalar ?? by projecting the 	samples ?? onto a line $$y=w^{T}x $$
	\item Of all the possible lines we would like to select 	the one that maximizes the separability of the scalars.
	\item Fisher suggested maximizing the difference between 	the means, normalized by a measure of the within-class 	scatter
