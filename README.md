Description:

**Linear_regression_mv**:
In this notebook I present a work on multivariable linear regression using Boston house-price dataset, first selecting the two variables with the most correlation with the desired target variable for prediction, then training a multivariable regression model, and finally plotting the hypersurface generated by the predictions of the model and comparing it with the actual data.

**Logistic_regression_mv**:
In this notebook I present a work on multivariable logistic regression using Iris dataset, there are three possible categories for classification.

**Linear discriminant analysis**:
* LDA seeks to reduce dimensionality while preserving 	as much of the class discriminatory information as possible
* Assume we have a set of N-dimensional samples of which *N1* belong to class *w1*, and *N2* to class w2*
* We seek to obtain a scalar y by projecting the samples onto a line 
* Of all the possible lines we would like to select the one that maximizes the separability of the scalars.
*Fisher suggested maximizing the difference between the means, normalized by a measure of the within-class scatter
