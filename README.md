Linear_regression_mv:
In this notebook I present a work on multivariable linear regression using Boston house-price dataset, first selecting the two variables with the most correlation with the desired target variable for prediction, then training a multivariable regression model, and finally plotting the hypersurface generated by the predictions of the model and comparing it with the actual data.
